= Clustering

== Overview

In this chapter, we discuss different roles nodes can play in a cluster and the different ways nodes can discover each other to form a cluster.

On start-up, a node is assigned either one of the two roles: _server node_ or _client node_. Server nodes are the workhorses of the cluster; they cache data, execute compute tasks, etc.
Client nodes join the topology as regular nodes but they do not store data. Client nodes are used to stream data into the cluster and execute user queries.

To form a cluster, each node must be able to connect to all other nodes. To ensure that, a proper <<Discovery Mechanisms,discovery mechanism>> must be configured.


NOTE: In addition to client nodes, you can use Thin Clients to define and manipulate data in the cluster.
Learn more about the thin clients in the link:developers-guide/thin-clients/getting-started-with-thin-clients[Thin Clients] section.

== Servers and Clients
There are two types of nodes: _server nodes_ and _client nodes_. Server nodes participate in caching, compute execution, stream processing, etc. Native client nodes provide the ability to connect to the
servers remotely.
Ignite native clients allow using the whole set of `Ignite APIs`, including near caching, transactions, compute, streaming, services, etc. from the client side.

By default, all Ignite nodes are started as server nodes, and you should explicitly enable the client mode.

IMPORTANT: Once a distributed cache is created, it is automatically deployed on all the existing and future _server_ nodes.

You can configure a node to be either a client or a server via the `IgniteConfiguration.setClientMode(...)` property.

Alternatively, for convenience, you can also enable or disable the
client mode though the `Ignition` class to allow clients and servers to
reuse the same configuration.

== Discovery Mechanisms

Nodes can automatically discover each other and form a cluster.
This allows you to scale out when needed without having to restart the whole cluster.
Developers can also leverage Ignite's hybrid cloud support that allows establishing connection between private and public clouds such as Amazon Web Services, providing them with the best of both worlds.

The discovery mechanism goes with two implementations intended for different usage scenarios:

* link:developers-guide/clustering/tcp-ip-discovery[TCP/IP Discovery] is designed and optimized for 100s of nodes.
* link:developers-guide/clustering/zookeeper-discovery[ZooKeeper Discovery] that allows scaling Ignite clusters to 100s and 1000s of nodes preserving linear scalability and performance.

== Communication SPI

`CommunicationSpi` provides basic plumbing to send and receive messages and is utilized for all distributed operations, such as task execution, monitoring data exchange, distributed event querying, and others.
Ignite provides `TcpCommunicationSpi` as the default implementation of `CommunicationSpi`, that uses the TCP/IP to communicate with other nodes.

To enable communication with other nodes, `TcpCommunicationSpi` adds `TcpCommunicationSpi.ATTR_ADDRS` and `TcpCommunicationSpi.ATTR_PORT` local node attributes.
On start-up, this SPI tries to start listening to the local port specified by the `TcpCommunicationSpi.setLocalPort(int)` method.
If the local port is occupied, then the SPI automatically increments the port number until it can successfully bind it.
The `TcpCommunicationSpi.setLocalPortRange(int)` configuration parameter controls the maximum number of ports that the SPI tries before it fails.

[TIP]

=== Local port range

Port range comes in very handy when starting multiple nodes on the
same machine or even in the same VM. In this case, all nodes can be
brought up without a single change in the configuration.

=== IPv4 vs IPv6

Ignite tries to support IPv4 and IPv6 but this can sometimes lead to issues where the cluster becomes detached. A possible solution — unless you require IPv6 — is to restrict Ignite to IPv4 via the `-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true` JVM parameter.

Below is an example of `TcpCommunicationSpi` configuration. Refer to the
link:{javadoc_base_url}/org/apache/ignite/spi/communication/tcp/TcpCommunicationSpi.html[TcpCommunicationSpi javadoc,window=_blank] for the complete list of parameters.
